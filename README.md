A PHP Framework from scratch.

# What is it's purpose?
It's a framework aiming to create a fast and easy solution for people that don't want too much crammed in a framework..
under 100kb.

# I want a templating engine! I want this and that!
I have already put those [here](https://github.com/testcore-labs/qkit-modules)

## Deployment

To deploy this project, run:
```bash
  composer require
```
.. and that's it. Dead simple.

Will document more, just go into the `core/` folder and you will be able to read it mostly.. `public/index.php` has examples for routing.
